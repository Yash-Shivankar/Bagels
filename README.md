 Bagels, a deductive logic game.

I am thinking of a 3-digit number with no repeated digits.
Try to guess what it is. Here are some clues:
When I say:    That means:
  Pico         One digit is correct but in the wrong position.
  Fermi        One digit is correct and in the right position.
  Bagels       No digit is correct.

I have thought up a number.
 You have 10 guesses to get it.
Guess #1: 
> 123
Fermi
Guess #2: 
> 023
Fermi
Guess #3:
> 020
Bagels
Guess #4:
> 003
Fermi
Guess #5:
> 103

Guess #6:
> 503

Guess #7:
